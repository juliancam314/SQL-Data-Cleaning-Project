## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project
Welcome to the Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project! In this project, I attempted to refine and enhance a dataset containing valuable housing information from Nashville, Tennessee. Leveraging the power of SQL, I cleaned and prepared the data, transforming it into a structured and insightful resource ready for analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview
The housing dataset provided a wealth of information, ranging from property details to pricing dynamics, offering a comprehensive snapshot of Nashville's real estate landscape. However, before diving into further data analysis and modeling, it was essential to address the inherent imperfections and inconsistencies within the dataset.

## Data Cleaning Process
My data cleaning process attempted to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability in the dataset. Leveraging SQL's robust functionalities, I tackled missing values, outliers, and formatting discrepancies, ensuring that the dataset met the highest standards of quality and integrity.

## Key Objectives
-Data Consistency: Harmonizing disparate data sources and formats to establish uniformity.

-Accuracy Enhancement: Addressing null data points to fortify the dataset's reliability.

-Insightful Preparation: Aggregating and transforming raw data to unlock valuable insights and allow for better analysis.

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the scripts, queries, and documentation detailing the data cleaning journey.
